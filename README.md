### **About:**

Create: Food is an add-on for [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight-refabricated) based on expanding food content found in Create, Farmer's Delight, and vanilla MC. This mod is designed with compatibility in mind, with various features to help integration with other mods.

### **Current Content:**

* Available for both Fabric & Forge. Differences between versions are listed [here](https://github.com/AverageAnime/create-food/wiki/Fabric-&-Forge-Differences).

Check out the full item list [here](https://github.com/AverageAnime/create-food/wiki/Item-List) and preview textures [here](https://github.com/AverageAnime/create-food/wiki/Preview).
* Numerous tag additions to enhance mod compatibility. Includes a tag-based system to apply Farmer's Delight food effects and vanilla status effects to any item with the appropriate tag (Fabric only).
* All recipes use tags where possible. Includes additional recipe support for [satisfy’s](https://www.curseforge.com/members/satisfy/projects) [Let’s Do] mods.
