### ***0.0.1-beta***
*Note: Most information on CurseForge/Modrinth/Github is specific to Fabric versions.*

* Includes about 40+ new food items not yet in the Fabric version.
* All items/fluids/blocks are enabled, no config.
* Food effects are added the normal way, not via tags. Tooltips are not added. Use this [mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/food-effect-tooltips-forge) to see them.
* Create & Farmer's Delight are required dependencies.
* The cakes this mod adds can be right-clicked to remove a single slice, just like pies & pizzas.
* Does not include built-in resource packs. Use the files from the Fabric version if you want extra visual consistency.
